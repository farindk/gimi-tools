# GIMI Tools

GIMI = Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) Imagery Media for ISR.

GIMI is a file-format building upon HEIF for storing images, image sequences, and video together with geospatial metadata, stored as RDF in the Turtle format.
This repository contains tools to facilitate converting between GeoTIFF and GIMI files.
